# Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to convert

### Important rules

The file will **ONLY** be created, if the sheet's name starts with `convert` and finishes with an excel extension e.g. `convert.xlsx` or `convert.xls` .

**Rename** your Excel sheet in order to convert to JSON, otherwise your file will **not be converted**

Put the file in the **root** of the project. Any error will be _printed in your console_

### After the conversion

A `output.json` file will be generated, it gonna have all of your excel sheet info
